# An End-to-End Automated Framework for Data Curation, Feature Engineering, and Explainable Modeling in Big Data Analytics.

## What is Data Curation ? 
This is the process of gathering, cleaning, and organizing data so that it can be easily used and understood.

## What is Feature Engineering ? 
Feature engineering means taking raw data and turning it into useful pieces of information (features) that help a machine learning model work better. 

## How can we Explain Modeling in the field of Big Data Analytics ?
Modeling is about building and training algorithms to learn from large amounts of data. In the world of big data, it means using these advanced methods to find patterns, predict future trends, or understand complex relationships within the data.
